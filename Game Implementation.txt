Hide and Seek API implementaiton:
Our design implements the common API as follows. First in order to get someone else's IUser or for them to get our
IUser, we use RMI and bind an IUser to the Registry as soon as the client for running games starts up. This IUser bound
to the Registry will be us in the game that we wish to join and as a result it will receive and process InstallCmd messages
using a MessageDataPacketAlgo to install the MessageDataPacketAlgoCmds it receives. Similarly since this IUser knows
how to play our game we can get the commands from it and install them onto an other IUser we are connected to. This
will be how Game commands are installed.

In order to actually play the game it will all come down to passing messages to other IUsers and having them process 
these messages. In addition, every IUser will have it's own IGroup and access to a MixedDataDictionary that it will 
use to store knowledge about the game. After it processes these messages, which are sent through Data Packets, it will
send back a StatusDataPacket to the one sending them to let the sender know that the message has been processed.

Our game's unknown commands will have to deal with moving yourself around and communicating
with other players. Even though each player will be unable to see other players changing location on the map unless
they are within sight radius each player's map will update whenever anybody moves because there is the possibility
that the person who moved is within your sight radius or moved within your sight radius.
