How to connect to/start the game:
	1. 	Connect to the server.
	2.	Send a IJoinMessage to our Client.
	3.	The game is now installed on your system. A WWJ Map and Chatroom should
			pop-up on your screen as static components.
	4.	The game is now started by the server once enough people have joined.
		

Connect to other players:
	The server automatically puts you on teams and puts you in a chatroom with
		the other players on your team. When playing the game you will
		see the other players on the map.

		
General Controls:
	Start: To select your starting position, right-click anywhere on the map.
		It is highly suggested that you stay away from the North and South
		Poles, as the Earth's curved shape can cause you to fall off the WWJ
		map.
		
	Controls: Each turn, right-click somewhere to move there. You can only move
		a limited distance each turn, so if you click outside of your
		move-radius you will move as far as possible as you can in that
		direction. ONLY THE FIRST CLICK PER TURN COUNTS.
		
	Rounds: Each new round is started after everyone has selected a new
		position to move to. The server can choose to start the rounds
		whenever is convenient. 
		
		
Hiders:
	Goal: Stay away from the seekers until the end of the game (until the 
		server decides enough time has gone on and ends the game).

	Hints: Try to coordinate with your team so that you don't bunch up and make
		it easy for the seekers to catch you!
		

Seekers:
	Goal: Catch all of the hiders by moving on top of them.

	Hints: Try to coordinate with your team so that you surround the hiders and
		don't give them an avenue of escape!
		
		
How to end/exit:
	Once a team wins the server will send a win/lose message to each team, and
		the game will end. After that each user is free to close the client.
	If you want to leave early, leaving nicely will remove you from the game
		without crashing (you send a leave message).
